- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS positioning (absolute)
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned several key CSS concepts and techniques:

- **Flexbox for horizontal layouts**: I learned how to structure elements horizontally using Flexbox and create responsive card layouts.
- **Element alignment**: I learned how to align text and icons in a single row using `display: flex` and `align-items: center`.
- **Staircase/staggered layouts**: I learned how to create incremental "staircase" layouts by applying different `margin-top` values to create visual depth.
- **CSS positioning**: I practiced using `position: absolute` with `transform: translate()` for precise element positioning.
- **Text and image alignment**: I learned how to position text next to images using `inline-block` with `vertical-align: top`.
- **BEM methodology**: I practiced structuring HTML classes using the Block, Element, Modifier naming convention.
- **HSL color management**: I learned how to work with HSL color values for consistent theming and subtle color variations.
- **Spacing and typography**: I practiced using `padding`, `line-height`, and `gap` properties to create proper spacing and improve readability.
